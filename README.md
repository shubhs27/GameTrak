# Java Game and Store Management Project

## Overview
This project is a Java-based application designed to manage game-related data and store operations. The application contains multiple classes, each responsible for different aspects of the project, such as game mechanics, store management, and database operations.

## Files

### 1. `Games.java`
Handles game-related functionalities, potentially including game mechanics, scoring, or player interactions.

### 2. `Store.java`
Manages store functionalities, such as adding and displaying items, handling transactions, and potentially managing inventory.

### 3. `Store_db.java`
Responsible for database operations related to the store, such as connecting to a database, retrieving data, and updating records related to inventory, sales, or customer information.

### 4. `Store_Use.java`
Serves as the main driver for integrating the game and store functionalities, utilizing `Store.java` and `Store_db.java` to enable a cohesive application experience.

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher
- **Database Setup**: Ensure the database is set up if `Store_db.java` interacts with one

## How to Run
1. **Compile** the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac Games.java Store.java Store_db.java Store_Use.java
   ```
2. **Run** the main application:
   ```bash
   java Store_Use
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience
- Expanding game mechanics and store management features
- Implementing more complex database interactions
